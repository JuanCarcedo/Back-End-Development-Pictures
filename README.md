## IBM Skills Network - Intro to the project
The starting point of this project can be found here [IBM Project](https://github.com/ibm-developer-skills-network/luggb-Back-End-Development-Pictures). This is a template (not a fork).  
I implemented the necessary code to make this project work (initial structure given, please check the repository).

Changes:
+ updated ```backend/data/routes.py```

### Background
Your client has asked you to build a website for a famous band. The backend developer on the project has recently left, and you need to finish the code so the website can go live. The application consists of some different microservices working together.  
You are asked in this lab to finish the Get Pictures microservice. This microservice stores URLs of pictures from past events. The previous developer started a Python Flask-based REST API and wrote some tests following the TDD or test driven development process. You will need to get the code from GitHub and fill in the missing pieces so that the code can pass all tests.

_This part relates to the Pictures' management._

I use WSL for simple CURL test.
